#ListMix2

This application is a playlist application which is portable, and can be used when I dont have internet. It is intended to be used along with the website http://www.youtube-mp3.org/ because I dont like paying for my music. Right now I am reading in the information about each song from the file name itself. The format it reads looks like this

Artist - Song_Name.mp3

Incidentally all songs on youtube have that format if it is an official music channel.. The beauty of this application is if i have a directory on a usb with all of my youtube music in it, then i can just select the directory, and the application will load all the songs into your music library using recursion.

To run:
1.) Download zip file of the project.
2.) Open Eclipse
3.) Extract zip file
4.) File > Import > Existing File into Workspace > ListMix2 (root directory) > Ok
5.) Expand ListMix2, expand src, expand gui, open ListMix.java and hit run!

Here is a screenshot of the playlist application!
